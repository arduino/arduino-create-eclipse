### p2:
The p2 update sites are available for each released version on GitHub as a ZIP archive. The `latest` p2 is available [here](https://github.com/TypeFox/arduino-eclipse/releases/latest/download/arduino-eclipse-p2.zip). If you want to use the p2 update URL inside Eclipse, you **must** prefix the URL with `jar:` and suffix it with `!/`.

   ```
   jar:https://github.com/TypeFox/arduino-eclipse/releases/latest/download/arduino-eclipse-p2.zip!/
   ```
 - Generic p2 URL pattern for any [`semver`](https://semver.org/) releases:
   ```
   jar:https://github.com/TypeFox/arduino-eclipse/releases/download/v${semver}/arduino-eclipse-p2.zip!/
   ```
 - Example for `0.0.1`:
