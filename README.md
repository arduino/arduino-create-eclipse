[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/typefox/Arduino/_apis/build/status/TypeFox.arduino-eclipse?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/typefox/Arduino/_build/latest?definitionId=6&branchName=master)

Eclipse Plug-in for importing projects into Eclipse CDT exported by [Arduino Create](https://create.arduino.cc).

### Requirements:
 - Java 8 or newer,
 - Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers 2018-12 (`4.10`) or newer,
 - [`make`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), and [`cmake`](https://cmake.org/download/) on the `PATH`.

### Build:
```
./mnvw clean verify
```

### Install:
The easiest way to install, is to drag and drop the `Install` button into your running Eclipse workspace. This plug-in is also [available at Eclipse Marketplace](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/arduino-create-eclipse-plug).

### p2:
The p2 update sites are available for each released version on GitHub as a ZIP archive. The `latest` p2 is available [here](https://github.com/TypeFox/arduino-eclipse/releases/latest/download/arduino-eclipse-p2.zip). If you want to use the p2 update URL inside Eclipse, you **must** prefix the URL with `jar:` and suffix it with `!/`.
 - URL of the `latest` p2:
   ```
   jar:https://github.com/TypeFox/arduino-eclipse/releases/latest/download/arduino-eclipse-p2.zip!/
   ```
 - Generic p2 URL pattern for any [`semver`](https://semver.org/) releases:
   ```
   jar:https://github.com/TypeFox/arduino-eclipse/releases/download/v${semver}/arduino-eclipse-p2.zip!/
   ```
 - Example URL for version `0.0.1`:
   ```
   jar:https://github.com/TypeFox/arduino-eclipse/releases/download/v0.0.1/arduino-eclipse-p2.zip!/
   ```

### Arduino Create:
The following Arduino Create export structures are supported:
 - Folder:
   ```
   _cmake
   |____ build (empty)
   |____ core
   |  |____ Arduino.h
   |  |____ (other core .h and .cpp files)
   |____ lib
   |  |____ (3rd party libraries if any)
   |____ sketch
   |  |___ sketch-file.ino.cpp
   |____ CMakeLists.txt   
   ```
 - ZIP:
   ```
   arduino_create-cmake.zip
   |____ _cmake
     |____ build (empty)
     |____ core
     |  |____ Arduino.h
     |  |____ (other core .h and .cpp files)
     |____ lib
     |  |____ (3rd party libraries if any)
     |____ sketch
     |  |___ sketch-file.ino.cpp
     |____ CMakeLists.txt
   ```

### Limitations:
Currently, you can build the imported Arduino Create project on Linux only.
 - Windows:
   ```
   C:\path\to\your\project\_cmake\core\shell.h:8:10: fatal error: sys/wait.h: No such file or directory
    #include <sys/wait.h>
             ^~~~~~~~~~~~
   compilation terminated.
   ```
 - macOS:
   ```
   /path/to/your/project/_cmake/core/DebugSerial.h:56:2: error: unknown type name 'pthread_barrier_t'
       pthread_barrier_t _barrier;
       ^
   1 error generated.
